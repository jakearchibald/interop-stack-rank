As an experiment for [interop 2026](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/tree/main/2026), some of us involved in the process wanted to try a new way to gather feedback on which proposals matter most to developers.

This site lets you rank the proposals you care about, giving us data we can use when reviewing which proposals should be taken on for 2026.

**Please only rank proposals you feel positively about.** Anything you rank will be taken as a positive signal. If there are features you don't know or even feel negatively about, leave them unranked.

You don't need to rank everything. **Ranking ~10 items will give us great data to work with**.

In previous years, we've used social media and emoji reactions on GitHub issues to get an impression of how developers feel about particular proposals, but there's a couple of weaknesses to this approach.

**Simple reactions are gameable.** Someone with a significant following on social media can link to a proposal they feel strongly about, and ask their followers to 'upvote' it.

**Preference isn't captured.** A developer may üëç two proposals, but significantly prefer one over the other, if resources meant that only one could be chosen for 2026.

We're hoping that the results of this process will help us figure out which proposals matter the most to developers, but it won't be the only signal we use. For example, there would be a proposal that is low level, and may only be used by a small number of framework developers, but that may positively impact a large number sites on the web.
