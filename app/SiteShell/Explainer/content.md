As an experiment for [Interop 2026](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/tree/main/2026), we (the Firefox team) wanted to try a new way to gather feedback on which proposals matter most to developers.

This site lets you rank the proposals you care about, giving us data we can use when reviewing which proposals should be taken on for 2026.

**Please only rank proposals you feel positively about.** Anything you rank will be taken as a positive signal. If there are features you don't know or even feel negatively about, leave them unranked.

You don't need to rank everything. **Ranking ~10 items will give us great data to work with**. Rankings autosave â€“ keep tweaking the list until you're happy with it.
