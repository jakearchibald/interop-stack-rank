As an experiment for [Interop 2026](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/tree/main/2026), we (the Firefox team) wanted to try a new way to gather feedback on which proposals matter most to developers.

We allowed you to rank the proposals you care about, giving us data we can use when reviewing which proposals should be taken on for 2026.

Over 1900 of you completed rankings, with the average ranking being 16 items. Given there was so much data to work through, we really appreciate the time you took to help us out!

**The poll is now closed**, and the results have already influenced the proposals we're prioritizing for Interop 2026.

In February 2026, the Interop project will publish the final selection of proposals.

<summary>How your data was stored and used</summary>

Your ranked items are stored on the server, keyed against your Github user ID, along with your Github name, username, and avatar URL. This is visible to select members of the Firefox team.

Only your ranked items are stored on the server. The order of unranked items was initially random, then stored locally, so the order was stable.

We shared the individual rankings with the Interop team for analysis, but without the associated Github data (ids, name, username, avatar URL).

Given that this is an experiment, and isn't the only data source that will be considered as part of choosing Interop proposals, we may not publish a summary of the data publicly.
